<h2>Summary of website</h2>
<p>This website showcases some of Scotland's film festivals. 
It provides information on some of famous and less well-known festivals across the country.
Each festival has a dedicated page, and there is a contact page, as well as the info page you 
are currently reading which gives an overview of the website and well as pointing to where each 
of the assessment criteria are met.</p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>A sans serif font has been used and a colour scheme that allows for contrast e.g. between 
text and background colour. All images have been given alternative text. Drop down navigation has 
been used. All images and videos have been optimised. Media queries have been used to make the site 
accessible on various devices.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Security was addressed by ensuring the site uses HTTPS for encrypted communication, 
    preventing data from being intercepted. Form inputs were designed with HTML5 validation 
    to reduce incorrect or harmful entries, and no sensitive information is stored in the HTML. 
    External links include rel="noopener noreferrer" to prevent clickjacking, and file permissions 
    on the server are set correctly to avoid unauthorized changes. Strong passwords are used for 
    hosting and FTP access. These measures help protect user data and maintain the integrity of the website.</p>
<h2>Improvments</h2>
<p>The website could be improved by making the navigation more user friendly for smaller screens, i.e. mobile phones.
    A CAPTCHA could be added to the form. A blog or news section could be added as well as an interactive map with
    festival locations.
